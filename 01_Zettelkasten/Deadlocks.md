Let me explain a real world (not actually real) example for a deadlock situation from the crime movies. Imagine a criminal holds an hostage and against that, a cop also holds an hostage who is a friend of the criminal. In this case, criminal is not going to let the hostage go if cop won't let his friend to let go. Also the cop is not going to let the friend of criminal let go, unless the criminal releases the hostage. This is an endless untrustworthy situation, because both sides are insisting the first step from each other.
